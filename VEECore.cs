 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Project-Solution last stand: 05.06.2019 
 * so I must pass on the new Errornumbers
 * 
 * OS-Build 18945 winerror.h from 20.07.2019 - 1.475 KB
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Windows 10 OS-Build 18945 SDK or higher to Final Release 2020 have an NEW
 * Error System and Errornumbers. One Headerfile for all Errors.
 * The winerror.h all errors inside in blocks:
 * System Errors, COM Errors, 
 * 
 * 
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTE: winerror.h stand in:
 * C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.18945.0\shared
 * Search for "**** Available SYSTEM error codes ****" 
 * to find where to insert new error codes
 * New  Facilities and Error Codes, Microsoft take an new order of Errornumbers
 * Microsoft make now modules for Windows Operation System, means split off,
 * Shell, Kernel, User and more, Shell Update Agent make only update about
 * news. 
 * Microsoft change Programming Language from C/C++ to Rust by Security
 * in Kernel..., while have massive problems 
 * about C++ in Memory, Storage Security, Rust come with Security Methods.
 * 
 * New is Cortana as separate app, Text Cursor Indicator with color,
 * New many Functions about Network Client/Server by Professional Edition,
 * while is an Workstation to Server. (have the same codebase)
 *
